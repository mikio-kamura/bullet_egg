The concept is as follows. The sphere will be turned into an egg.

----

The egg, that is you, would quickly roll around and fall off with little force on the flat surface of the kitchen table. 
The egg spent its days precariously, always next to danger. 
The egg, left unattended on the kitchen table, were therefore in search of a place where they could feel safe.

One day, the egg felt a surge of inner power.
It could move on its own!
And then, far above it, it recognized a bowl that seemed to support it gently and sturdily.
"Maybe that's where I belong...!"

The purpose of this application is for the egg, temporarily endowed with the skill to move on its own, to jump and move from the unstable horizontal plane and land safely in the bowl resting on top of the kitchen, thus gaining its long-awaited stability.

----

The bowl, cutting board and knife were created in Blender.

The main movement functions of the egg are implemented as forward/backward/left/right movement, acceleration, stopping, and jumping (double jumping is not allowed), and collision detection is used to reach the goal.

I plan to design a better world and functions in the future.
